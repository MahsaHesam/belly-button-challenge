This project is about building an interactive dashboard to analyze the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset contains information about the different microbes (tiny organisms) that live in people's belly buttons.
The project seems to focus on the surprising variety of these microbes. Even though a few types of microbes are common and found in most people, there are many other rare microbes that can live in belly buttons. The dashboard you'll build will likely allow for exploring this variety and distribution of microbes across the dataset.
